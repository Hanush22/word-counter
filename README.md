# DESCRIPTION

This Python project provides a basic word count functionality. It takes a string of text as input, then processes it by splitting the text into individual words using spaces as separators. The program then calculates the number of words by determining the length of the resulting word list. Finally, it outputs the total word count, offering a simple and straightforward way to quantify the number of words in a given text string. This simple version ignores punctuation and focuses on the core task of counting space-separated words, serving as a fundamental exercise in Python text processing.
